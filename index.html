    <p>Mob programming is an approach to software development where the entire team works together on same task. <br>
       They can be in the same place using the same computer. <br>
       It can also be a remote mob programming session where the team collaborate through live share.<br>
       Even though the computer itself is not the same when working remotely,<br>
       the liveshare makes it possible for all participants to code in the same file.<br>
       One person in the team usually acts as a host and creates the files and starts the live share session.<br>
       Mob programming has many benefits. It helps the team to code with a higher pace and come up with more creative solutions.  </p>
